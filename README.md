# <p id="1">About our project</p>

## Website link <a href="https://fundneedy-1289c.web.app/">FundNeedy</a>

In this world there are many great minds, who come up with innovative ideas, for the greater good. But due to circumstances like financial troubles, these ideas remain as only a mere dream. FundNeedy is a crowdfunding platform, which aims to raise money for these people, ranging from funding organizations in need, to emergency situations in someone's life like accidents or illness.

## Combining opposites

We are combining two opposite things, in relation with money. People who can't afford to fund in something, say for a project or in case of emergency, open up fund requests, in hope for that other people,mainly the rich people, can fund them in order to help and let them achieve their goal, without havingany financial trouble. The rich helps the poor achieve their goal, financially, hence two opposite things combining for the greater good.
